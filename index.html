<h2>mipso's story</h2>

<p class="fontgeorgia tindent">
      MIPSO is a bluegrass-influenced band out of Chapel Hill.
      Here is how Libby describes her song writing in an interview with the Glide Magazine:<span class="italic">
      “I’m not really a guitar player. I kind of get a melody in my head. But then I give it some form, usually on the guitar,
      sometimes on the piano, but because I play a melody instrument, I don’t usually think in chords as much.
      I think about melodies before I think about chords. So that song, when I got it in my head, I didn’t have any idea what the
      chords were going to be, I just had the melody. And if you listen, the whole–I don’t know if it’s a verse or a chorus–but
      that whole first section, it’s one chord. It never changes. And it was just because maybe I don’t hear as many chords."</span>
